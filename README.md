# UI candidates test v2.0

The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and mounted on GitHub Pages. You can visit a builded version [here](https://nandoe14.github.io/zemoga-uitest).

The project doesn't have the Node part resolved, was focused just on Front-End side.

I developed the test in such a way that you can increase the number of characters you want to show and whose information is contained in the "json" file. Any number of characters can be included or omitted so the application displays, organizes and makes them functional automatically.
